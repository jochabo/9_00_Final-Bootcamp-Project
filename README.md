# 9_00_Final-Bootcamp-Project
This project is about exploring and predicting the daily coffee bean prices by exploring their main drivers. The dataset was collected from different spots.


# 1. Motivation: For my final project at the Ironhack Bootcamp I decided to analyse the coffee bean pricing. 

# 2. Features: Check out my final project presentation for a quick overview or my tableau page (https://public.tableau.com/views/FinalProjectBootcamp_Imports/Precipitation_Brazil?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to get some data evaluation insights. 

# 3. Data: The sources are shown in the notebook as markdown cells.
Sources include: OECD, Yahoo Finance, International Coffee Organization (ICO) and Nasa Weather API.

# 4. Model:
The prediction model was built and optimized using hyperparameters and feature selection. Resulting in the RandomForestRegressor providing the best results in terms of RMSE.
